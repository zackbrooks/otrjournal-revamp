## The Trucking Journal REVAMPED!(Temp Title)

This is a WIP revamp of my previous project "Trucking Journal".

## Why Are You Making This Project....Again????

Simplest answer is because I felt I was thinking too small. Truckers being able keep notes of companies and brokers is okay, but I can do so much more.
I view the first Trucking Journal as a sort of MVP of sorts. I plan on building off of what I learned in version 1, and expanding on it. I plan on expanding on the
"companies" part to allow truckers to add more instead of the two in version 1. Truckers will also be able to add "loads" now as well. That is one major thing
that truckers keep track of, probably the major thing they write down.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** MongoDB, Express, NextJS, NodeJS, Material UI, React Query, Zustand.
MERN stack like V1, but changed the CSS to Material UI and state management will be using React Query/Zustand. I usually use RTK/Context, so looking forward to what RQ and Zustand can do.

## Future Plans/Optimizations

I sort of touched on most of my future plans in a section above. Will just do a quick rundown since this is still a WIP.

- Add Load notes
- Improve UI/UX
- Make Site More Mobile Friendly
- Implementing \*Redacted\*
- Make A Mobile App with React Native

## Lessons Learned

Zustand and React Query is a nice combo. Using Zustand is way simpler than Redux/Context. This combo will most likely be used in my personal projects going forward.
